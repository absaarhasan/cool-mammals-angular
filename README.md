# Cool Mammals: Angular 1 example code

This is my equivalent to a To Do app. It's just a silly app to help demonstrate Angular 1 code.

The idea is to re-build this same app in all of the major frameworks, including Backbone, React/Redux, and Angular 2.

Here in my Angular 1 example, I have made a big effort to keep the code modularised and scalable.

It adheres to the John Pappa style guide with controller as VM and skinny controllers. I have also organised my files around "feature," as opposed "function" to make it easier to work with.

The app features a full set of unit tests, a responsive Bootstrap display, and all of the Angular basics such as ui-router, ng-forms, customised services, filters, and directives, etc.
