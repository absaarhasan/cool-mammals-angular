# Cool Mammals: Angular 1 example code

This is my equivalent to a To Do list. It's just a silly little app to demonstrate Angular 1 code.

I have organised my files around "feature," as opposed "function."

It demonstrates a Bootstrap responsive display, ui-router, ng-forms, customised directives, services, and filters, skinny controllers, and some effort to adhere to the John Pappa Style Guide.
